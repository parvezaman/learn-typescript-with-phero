## ***difference between js and ts***
- `ts` is a ***superset*** of `js`
- TSC (**Transcript compiler**) keeps compling the codes while you are writting the codes. On the other hand, in `js` you have to write the codes and then you got to run them and see the errors in the `console`. But in `TS` you will get the errors while you are writting the codes with the help of **TSC**.
- To understand  this first follow the example;
    ```
    let person ={
        name: "md. amanullah parvez",
        occupation: "student"
    }
    ```
